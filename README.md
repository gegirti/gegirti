I’m @gegirti,I’m interested in pretty much anything thus I am a professional student and will always be.
I’m currently learning how to live in general, however if you are more interested in IT, I'm learning HTML and CSS, JS, React and things. -this will be surely updated-
I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much everything or nothing.
