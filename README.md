# Hellow fellow human being!
I’m interested in pretty much anything thus I am a **professional student** and will always be.
I’m currently learning how to live in general (like, staying alive and breathe and eat and such, seriously), however if you are more interested in IT, I'm learning python in these days. -this will be surely updated- 

I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much everything or nothing.
